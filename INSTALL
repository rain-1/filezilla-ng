Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Requirements
---------------

FileZilla depends on the following libraries:
- libfilezilla 0.9.1 or greater
- wxWidgets 3.0.2 or greater
- libidn (only if not on Windows and not having gettaddrinfo with AI_IDN support)
- Nettle 3.1 or greater
- GnuTLS 3.4.15 or greater
- libdbus on *nix
- sqlite3 3.7 or greater

To compile FileZilla 3, the following tools need to be installed:
- A C++14 compiler, e.g. a recent GCC or Clang
- GNU make
- GNU gettext

Optional tools:
- recent automake, autoconf if you plan to change configure.in or any of the
  Makefile.am files
- CppUnit if you want to run the tests
- NSIS if you want to create the Windows installer

If crosscompiling, a native wxrc tool, which is part of wxWidgets, has to
exist or compilation will fail

2. Compilation
--------------

If using source from the project's Subversion repository,
execute autoreconf -i first to generate configure. This step is
not necessary for source distributions.

Assuming you are in the top source directory, execute the following commands:

mkdir compile
cd compile
../configure
make
make install

The configure script will inform you about missing dependencies or other
issues with your build environment.
